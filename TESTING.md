### CI Pep8 Validator

Screenshot of validator after final deployment to come.

### Manual testing:

| Feature | Expectation | Testing | Result |
| ------- |:-----------:|:-------:| ------:|
| Story flow | All story steps flow correctly (can get to the end of the game, either succeding or failing, by taking the options available) | I trialled every single option using my flow diagram, checking each option led to the right next step and correctly reached the end of the game by succeeding or failing. | All steps flow as planned |
| Game visual | Text window should look a little more fun than pure text by the use of spacing, positioning, hyphenation and use of $ sign | Checked each flow and added/adjusted as necessary | Looking good after adjustments |
