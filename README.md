# The adventures of Meowshmallow and Peppurrmint

Follow Meowshmallow and Peppurrmint, two inquisitive cats on a quest for the fabled golden fish!

I really wanted to make a text based game for this project, being old enough to hark from the era of text based MUDs and other old geekery. My dream is to make a fully interactive game, with items to pick up and use, and squares that the user can navigate around much like the games of yonder year.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* I want to take part in a pub quiz online and improve my general knowledge. I want to be able to play at any time, anywhere.
* I want the site to be responsive to my device.
* I want the site to be easy to navigate.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

* I want to be able to choose a level of difficulty that I feel is appropriate for me, based on my experience from my first visit to the site.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals

* I want to be able to adjust the difficulty level to keep improving my knowledge.
* I want to be able to log my high scores to see how I am performing.

## Design

The design is structural in nature as opposed to visual, as although I know the Python terminal can be style, the time I have to implement this project requires full focus on the functionality only.

### Flowchart

Since the game changes depending on the users' choices, I wanted to lay out the step by step logic needed to reach each ending of the game. Although there are only two outcomes there are multiple ways to get there.

## Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

* Add further functionality such as:
  - More options/alternate endings.
  - In game items to interact with.
* Styling the game to provide a more visually exciting experience for the user.

### Code Used

### Content

I have used [OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com/) to create most of the text for me so I can focus my time on practicing with the code. "We" had a little chat and went over some iterations and I'm happy that it was able to work out the structure for continuing the game, and then I was able to build the flow chart and thus work on the code structure from there.

### Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge the following people:

* My partner for his extra help looking after our little one so I could focus on getting as much learning in as possible, and for providing his insight into logical thinking and good practices to breaking down a problem into manageable chunks. ðŸ¥°

// Keeping the text below until completion to ensure I cover all bases!
## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.
